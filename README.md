## Introduction
Welcome to the Human-NG Framework! This project is here to help you manage different parts of your life more easily and effectively. From personal tasks to community activities, Human-NG provides practical, step-by-step guides that you can adjust to fit your needs.

The project consists of an organized collection individual pieces of information, called **runners**. Runners serve as summaries, guides, and references on all topics of life, based on the latest and best information that humanity has. Runners can be:

1. **Low-level**, such as "Efficient Laundry Management System", or "How to Pay Taxes".
2. **High-level**, such as "How to Avoid Burnout," or "How to Raise a Strong, Happy Family".
3. **Simple or complex**, whatever is appropriate for the runner.
4. **Human- and AI-compatible**, to maximize the benefit to you.
5. **Scientifically backed**, where possible (such as health regimens, nutrition, etc).
6. **Assertive**, with knowledge from experts in their fields.

## Purpose of Human-NG
The Human-NG Framework aims to be a one-stop system where you can find, submit, and vote on useful guides for everyday life. With the help of AI, these guides can be updated and improved over time to keep them relevant and helpful. Our goal is to make managing your life simpler and less stressful.

Ultimately, it's all about improving humanity through transparency and alignment. This system allows all of us to define and align on what's most important to us. It also keeps AI in alignment with our values. 

## Integration with AI Systems
Human-NG Framework provides a beneficial tool for AI via:

- **Personalization**: AI can analyze your habits and preferences to tailor frameworks to your specific needs. Enrich this system with your own dataset to provide additonal context to your AI assistant. Remove the data you don't want included. 
- **Automation and Optimization**: Repetitive tasks can be documented and automated, and AI can provide data-driven recommendations to improve efficiency and effectiveness.
- **Alignment**: AI ensures that the frameworks align with your personal goals and values, helping you stay on track and focused on what matters most.
- **Continuous Improvement**: All history and changes are transparent, so you can see how topics evolve and improve over time. AI helps ensure that the frameworks stay current and effective by learning from user feedback and behavior.

## Framework for Everything
At the heart of the Human-NG project lies the "Framework for Everything," a comprehensive system designed to enhance various aspects of life. This framework is organized into logical categories that cover personal well-being, household management, relationships, professional life, technology integration, and community involvement. Each category is structured to provide practical, actionable guidance to help users manage their lives more effectively.

The scope of the project is broad, encompassing everything from individual health and time management to family dynamics and community engagement. By addressing these diverse areas, the framework aims to provide a holistic approach to life management that is both practical and adaptable to individual needs.

Central to the framework are the detailed documents known as "Runners." These runners compile the best practices, proven frameworks, and practical systems for managing various life areas. Often serving as hubs of information on complex or controversial topics, runners reflect the best information we have access to, providing clear, actionable steps to help users achieve their goals and improve their quality of life. Based on science and humanity's collective wisdom.

## How to Get Involved

1. We will always need more and better information. Start exploring and contributing today! 
3. Use this system with your own personal AI assistants. And tell me what you think!
4. As this project grows, it's clear there will be competing documents and opinions. We need to build the infrastructure to facilitate better open dialog and ranking of documents. If the demand is there, this project will build a webapp to allow users to edit, upvote, and discuss various documents and issues. Maybe we could sync to social media and implement user accounts to display people's contributions?

## Open Decision Points

1. Should runners be in markdown or yaml? It's possible that this project expands into a DB and is rendered via a webapp or API. YAML example:
